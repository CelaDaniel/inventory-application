- MongoDB and Mongoose: Used for data storage and schema validation.
- Models: Two main models - Items and Categories, supporting all CRUD operations.
- Pug Templating Engine: Used for designing views and generating HTML.
- Image Uploads: Enabled using Multer, allowing users to upload images for each inventory item.
