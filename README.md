# Inventory Application

This project is a Node.js-based Inventory Management Application. I created this to further learn Express. 

## Key technical aspects include:
- Node.js and Express.js: Used for building the server-side logic, handling routes, and HTTP requests.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: NoSQL database, used for data storage and schema validation.
- Models: Two main models - Items and Categories, supporting all CRUD operations.
- Pug Templating Engine: Used for designing views and generating HTML.
- Image Uploads: Enabled using Multer, allowing users to upload images for each inventory item.
- Security and Performance: Implementing web security and performance optimization best practices.
- Rate Limiting: Protecting the application from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
