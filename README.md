This project is a Node.js-based Inventory Management Application. Key technical aspects include:
- Node.js and Express.js: Used for building the server-side logic, handling routes, and HTTP requests.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: Used for data storage and schema validation.
- Models: Two main models - Items and Categories, supporting all CRUD operations.
- Pug Templating Engine: Used for designing views and generating HTML.
- Image Uploads: Enabled using Multer, allowing users to upload images for each inventory item.
- Security: Destructive actions are protected by a secret admin password.
